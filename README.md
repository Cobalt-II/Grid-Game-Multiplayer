Multiplayer version of Grid Game. Written with Socket.io.

Major new content from single player version: multiplayer capability (in a PvE world where enemies spawn and chase you, if enemies are too easy stats can be edited in the enemydata file, and additionally this is simply the first version. I plan on adding more content), spawn codes (players can press the f key to copy a spawn code to their keyboard, which then anyone who inputs that code into the spawn code input in the menu will spawn at the coordinates that spawn code was made). A new weapon system (one grid tile that acts as your weapon can go in a 3x3 area around you. Use arrow keys to navigate the weapon).

v. 1: Project launch. To be honest it's not really that fun atm, this is more just a first initialization of the game. players can join and play together, might be small bugs I haven't found yet.

v. 1.1: Added player scores.
